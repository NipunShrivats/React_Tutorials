1. It is an official toolset form the redux team that makes working with redux easier and less time consuming.
2. Instead of doing everything manually- like creating actions, reducers and managing state immutability - RTK gives built in function that handles most of the work for us.
3. Insimpler terms, its like shortcut that helps you manage your app's state with code and fewer mistakes. the goal is to make redux more beginner-friendly reduce the amount of code you need to write.
