## Redux Toolkit (RTK)

1. It is an official toolset form the redux team that makes working with redux easier and less time consuming.
2. Instead of doing everything manually- like creating actions, reducers and managing state immutability - RTK gives built in function that handles most of the work for us.
3. Insimpler terms, its like shortcut that helps you manage your app's state with code and fewer mistakes. the goal is to make redux more beginner-friendly reduce the amount of code you need to write.

## Advantages:-

1. less boiler plate code.
2. Easier to work with state.
3. Better Async Logic - handles thunk etc...

## conclusion:-

RTK setups redux Devtools, middleware and other configuration for us so we dont have to focus on building our app rather than setting it up.
